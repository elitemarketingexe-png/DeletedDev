/**
 * App-wide readiness signal that decouples "UI is visible and interactive"
 * from ViewModels that want to defer network work until after first frame.
 *
 * **Why this instead of a hard delay:**
 * A fixed timer (e.g. delay(1_500L)) is arbitrary — it may fire too early on
 * low-end devices and wastes time on high-end ones. This signal fires exactly
 * when [MainActivity] marks the UI as ready (after contentVisible = true and
 * the fade-in has begun), ensuring deferred work aligns with actual UI readiness
 * regardless of device speed.
 *
 * **Usage:**
 * - `AppReadinessSignal.markReady()` — called by MainActivity once content is visible.
 * - `AppReadinessSignal.awaitReady()` — suspend until ready; returns immediately if
 *   already ready (safe to call multiple times).
